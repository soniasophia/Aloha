## Personal Learnings
- My understanding of flexbox was heavily explored in this project and suspect that I will use the layout module more efficiently as I gain more practice with other projects.

- Handling background images takes a specific type of patience. Positioning, layering, and sizing in particular was tricky.

- How to abstract code a little bit better for more efficient styling. Trying to be more mindful of this.
